# Classify-the-Lunar-Rock-HackerEarth-Data-Science-Competition
● Here I am classifying between two types of Lunar rocks i.e Small and Large. <br/>
● Here I Have used google colab for training and inference purposes. <br/>
● The Link to the Competition is https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/lunar-rock-hackerearth-data-science-competition/ <br/>
● My Rank in this Competition was 51.<br/>
● The link to the dataset is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kT5GDYy-FoD5NQWTgD3ku-iFuiP7OqTS?usp=sharing . <br/>
● Here I have used Transfer Learning by using ResNet50 Architecture. <br/>
● I have used Keras for Image Classification. <br/>
● I trained the network for 7 epochs and I was getting validation accuracy of 95% and validation loss of 0.7998. <br/>
● Then I made the Confusion matrix for images in val. <br/>
